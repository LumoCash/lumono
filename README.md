### What is Lumono?

---

Lumono is a Nano's fork which keeps LumoCash up and running while its final code ends up being developed.

---

### Features

* Lumono utilizes the Nano's [block-lattice](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/wiki/Block-lattice) architecture, unlike conventional blockchains used in many other cryptocurrencies.
* The network requires minimal resources, no high-power mining hardware, and can process high transaction throughput.
* Offers instantaneous transactions with zero fees and unlimited scalability, making Lumo an ideal solution for peer-to-peer transactions.

For more information, see [Nano.org](https://nano.org/).
